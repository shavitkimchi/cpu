# CPU Logisim Design

A Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder built as an interactive web tool, modeled after logic design principles learned in class. The application simulates hardware encoding processes using a modern UI.

## Features

- Caesar cipher implementation in UI
- Logisim CPU modeling for educational logic analysis
- Visual interface for bitwise logic tracing
