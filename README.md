# CPU Logisim Design

This project is a CPU design implemented in Logisim, developed as part of the coursework for **Duke Universityâ€™s CS250: Computer Architecture** class.

The project involved designing a fully functional CPU capable of executing a custom instruction set, with components such as:
- Instruction memory
- Control unit
- ALU
- Register file
- Data memory
- Program counter and branching logic

The CPU was tested using a series of assembly programs and verified for correctness using Logisim simulation tools.
